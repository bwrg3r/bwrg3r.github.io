# [Crypto]
## Quantum-Web-Token

![|](./assets/crypto/question.png)

### TLDR:
- Implements BB84 quantum key distribution protocol
- Uses Qiskit for quantum circuit simulation
- Uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for communication
- Involves 32 qubits per round
- Goal: We need to guess Bob's measured bits (r_bits) correctly to get the flag

The vulnerability was indeed that `s_bits` (Alice's secret bits) were not regenerated for each new connection or session, allowing us to collect them over multiple rounds. Once all `s_bits`were known, we could use the xor values from the last round's qwt tokens to determine Bob's measured bits `r_bits` and submit the correct guess.

	- `/actuator/env`endpoint is exposed, and POST requests to it are enabled. 
	- This endpoint can reveal all environment variables.
2. **Proxy**: The index.js file defines how requests are forwarded.
	```js
	fastify.get('/pokemon', (r, s) => { const id = r.query.id || ''; return forward(r, s, 'GET', /pokemon/${id}) })
